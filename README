Delay-Adjustable D-Flip-Flop (named DAD-FF) is a radiation-hardened component 
where the robustness can be adjusted arbitrarily. Details can be found in the 
paper, "DAD-FF: Hardening Designs by Delay-Adjustable D-Flip-Flop for Soft-
Error-Rate Reduction", which appears in IEEE TVLSI. To make DAD-FF capable 
of utilizing by other designers who are interested in radiation hardening,
a baseline DAD-FF built upon NanGate FreePDK45 cell library is provided, as 
described in DADFF_56ps.sp. This document explains the use of DAD-FF including
the delay-time adjustment to meet your specification.


How to build the sample DAD-FF: DADFF_56ps.sp?
=======================================================
- Include the NanGate FreePDK45 bulk 45nm open cell library in the DUT.sp file
	.include '<dir>/NangateOpenCellLibrary_PDKv1_3_v2009_07/pre_spice/NangateOpenCellLibrary_pre.sp'
	.include '<dir>/NangateOpenCellLibrary_PDKv1_3_v2009_07/technology/models/hspice/tran_models/models_nom/NMOS_VTL.inc'
	.include '<dir>/NangateOpenCellLibrary_PDKv1_3_v2009_07/technology/models/hspice/tran_models/models_nom/PMOS_VTL.inc'
	
- Conduct SPICE simulation with DUT.sp 
	.> hspice DUT.sp
	
	
	
Important Nodes in DAD-FF
=======================================================
- After understanding the significance of these nodes, the robustness of DAD-FF can be evaluated and therefore can be redesigned by yourself.

- Please refer to Fig. 7 in "DAD-FF: Hardening Designs by Delay-Adjustable D-Flip-Flop for Soft-Error-Rate Reduction", which appears in IEEE TVLSI.

- In DUT.sp, DAD-FF is imported as a subcircuit: XDADFF D CLK Di_1 Di_2 Q QN Qo_1 Qo_2 VDD VSS DADFF_56ps, where
	Di_1 (node D in latch 1) is the input of the original data path,
	Di_2 (node D in SERL) is the input of the delayed date path,
	Qo_1 (node QA in latch 2) is the output of the original data path,
	Qo_2 (node QA in latch 3) is the output of the delayed data path.
	
	
	
How to evaluate the delay-time generation and soft-error detection of DAD-FF?
=======================================================
- Please refer to the waveform in DUT.jpg file.
	v(qo_1) and v(qo_2) are the outputs of the original data path and delayed data path.		
	v(di_1) and v(di_2) are the inputs of the original data path and delayed data path.
	v(q) is the output input of DAD-FF.
	v(d) is the input input of DAD-FF.
	v(clk) is the clock of DAD-FF.
	
- Delay times of DAD-FF can be measured by comparing v(di_1) and v(di_2) as illustrated in the time interval t=3ns to t=6ns.

- Given a SET occurring on v(d) at t=6ns, such SET will be captured by DAD-FF according to the different value on v(qo_1) and v(qo_2).

- Summary:
	Delay times of DAD-FF can be measured by v(di_1) and v(di_2).
	SET detection can be observed by comparing v(qo_1) and v(qo_2).
	
	
	
How to adjust the delay time of DAD-FF?
=======================================================
- There are 3 ways to adjust the delay time of DAD-FF:
	1. Changing the reference-voltage connection of VCP and VCN:
		In line 19 and line 57 of DADFF_56ps.sp, Vref* can be substituted by Vref1 to Vref5.
	2. Changing the transistor sizes of RVG:
		In line 64 to line 69 of DADFF_56ps.sp, the width of transistors can be adjusted.
	3. If 5 reference voltages is not sufficient enough, numbers of transistor in RVG can be extended.
		For example (7 reference voltages):
			Mref00 VDD VDD Vref1 VSS    
			Mref01 Vref1 Vref1 Vref2 VSS
			Mref02 Vref2 Vref2 Vref3 VSS
			Mref03 Vref3 Vref3 Vref4 VSS
			Mref04 Vref4 Vref4 Vref5 VSS
			Mref04 Vref5 Vref5 Vref6 VSS
			Mref04 Vref6 Vref6 Vref7 VSS
			Mref05 Vref7 Vref7 VSS VSS
